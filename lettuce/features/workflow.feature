Feature: Creating workflows
    In order to automate applications
    As a Macintosh user
    I want to create a workflow in Automator

    Scenario: Basic workflow
        Given an empty workflow
        And an Ask for Text action
        And a Speak Text action
        When I click Run
        And I enter "Lettuce" in the dialog
        And I click OK in the dialog
        Then the workflow runs successfully within 6 seconds

    Scenario: Short workflow
        Given an empty workflow
        And an Ask for Text action
        When I click Run
        And I enter "A short string of text" in the dialog
        And I click OK in the dialog
        Then the workflow runs successfully within 2 seconds
